Active ReC++

The C++ version of ActiveResource library.

Dependencies:
    CMake: www.cmake.org                        (the best buildsystem I've ever heard about!)
    libcurl: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/       (we need http requests)
    Boost: http://www.boost.org/                (boost is just plain cool, everyone should use it ;))
    Xerces-C++: http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/ (too complicated, but in c++)

    =all these libraries should be the part of the Linux distribution already
    =compilation on other systems is not yet tested

    (from recppful source directory)
    mkdir recppful_build
    cd recppful_build
